# Automatic_Login_page_Generator

Created an automatic login page generator which takes figma illustrations of login pages as input and generates HTML & CSS code for it. <br><br>

Technologies used : python, opencv, streamlit <br><br>

UPDATE : I have deployed this project on heroku ; but due to my inactivity, the account has been removed evidently removing the app from heroku as well :( <br><br>
Will be working to update the code not the logic ( to recall how bad my coding standards were ) as well as the deploying on cloud
